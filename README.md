SentimentNet: Leveraging Deep Learning for Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis in Social Media Texts
In the contemporary world, social media platforms have been used as major sources of user generated content in which various opinions on matters of concern are expressed. This is why business entities and different organisations focus on monitoring such sentiment due to its importance for effective business continuation. Text analysis techniques used in traditional setting do not fully or sufficiently capture the varied ways in which sentiments are expressed in social media texts. This problem is the focus of this project: “SentimentNet,” which uses deep learning to improve basic sentiment classification to a very specific level, which not only categorizes text as positive or negative, but as shades within positive and negative as well. As such SentimentNet aims at increasing sentiment classification accuracy through more enhanced NLP and more elaborative NN structures where basic approaches may fail. In the context of this work, the complexity of evaluating individual emotions in text-communication has never been ignored, and through extensive testing on real-world social media datasets, the capability of the proposed approach in capturing the specificity of the sentiment is to be proved
